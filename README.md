# User Experience

## Site Structure

The Premier League Quiz website is a single page with a quiz in the shape of a form for the user to complete.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
     The chosen font for the page was 'Readex Pro'. This font was chosen because it is easy to read, it is stylish, and because it is very similar to the official Premier League font.

 * ### Colour Scheme
     The colour scheme chosen for the page was based on the Official Premier League colour scheme for the 2021/2022 season. It features white, a pink (Amaranth) and a purple (Russian Violet).

  * ### The Quiz

      * The quiz is made up of 10 questions with varying difficulty, depending on the user's knowledge of the Premier League.
      * Each question has 4 possible asnwers in the form of radio buttons. This means only one of the choices can be picked.
      * Each question also has a corresponding image that may or may not be a clue to the answer.

      * When it is hovered over, the colours flip and there is a border around it.
